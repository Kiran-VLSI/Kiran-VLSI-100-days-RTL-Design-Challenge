# 100 Days RTL Design Challenge 🚀🎛️

Welcome to the **100 RTL Design Challenge** — a journey to master RTL (Register Transfer Level) design by coding and verifying a new RTL module **every day for 100 days**!

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Build strong, practical skills in RTL design and verification.
- Gain hands-on experience writing **Verilog** code and testbenches.
- Learn synthesis, simulation, and timing analysis.
- Become proficient with industry-standard tools: **Cadence Virtuoso**, **Xilinx Vivado**, and more.
- Prepare for careers in FPGA, ASIC design, and hardware verification.

---

## 📂 What’s Inside

- **Daily Verilog RTL modules** covering a wide range of digital design concepts.
- Comprehensive **testbenches** to verify each design.
- **Synthesis scripts and reports** for each module (where applicable).
- Organized folders for each day/module with clear naming conventions.
- Documentation and notes explaining design decisions and challenges.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Cadence Virtuoso** for analog/mixed-signal and custom layout-related RTL.
- **Xilinx Vivado** for FPGA synthesis, implementation, and simulation.
- **ModelSim / QuestaSim** for RTL simulation and waveform analysis.
- **GTKWave** for viewing waveform dumps (`.vcd` files).

---

## 🔥 Challenge Highlights

- Modules include combinational logic, sequential circuits, finite state machines, arithmetic units, memory elements, and more.
- Emphasis on good coding style, modular design, and testbench robustness.
- Focus on real-world problem solving with RTL.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse** the daily folders to explore individual RTL designs.
2. **Simulate** using the provided testbenches.
3. **Synthesize** using Vivado or Cadence scripts (where included).
4. **Modify** and extend designs to deepen your understanding.
5. **Contribute** by suggesting new module ideas or improving testbenches.
