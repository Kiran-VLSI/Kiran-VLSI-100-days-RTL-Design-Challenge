In VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration), an inverter is one of the most fundamental logic gates. It performs a logical NOT operation, meaning it inverts the input signal. If the input is `1`, the output is `0`, and vice versa.

Key Points About Inverters in VLSI✅
1. Symbol and Truth Table:
   - Symbol: A triangle with a small circle at its tip.
   - Truth Table:
     | Input | Output |
     |-------|--------|
     |   0   |   1    |
     |   1   |   0    |

2. Construction in CMOS Technology:
   - A CMOS inverter consists of:
     - PMOS transistor: Pulls the output high (to logic `1`) when the input is `0`.
     - NMOS transistor: Pulls the output low (to logic `0`) when the input is `1`.
   - The complementary nature of PMOS and NMOS transistors ensures low power dissipation during steady states.

3. Applications:
   - Used in building other complex digital circuits (AND, OR, Flip-Flops, etc.).
   - Acts as a buffer with logic inversion.
   - Essential in delay circuits, clock networks, and signal restoration.

4. Design Metrics:
   - Propagation Delay: Time taken for the signal to propagate through the inverter.
   - Power Consumption: Includes dynamic (switching) and static (leakage) power.
   - Noise Margins: Determines the inverter's ability to reject noise in the input signal.

5. Layout in VLSI:
   - The inverter's physical design involves arranging PMOS and NMOS transistors, with metal interconnects to define the input, output, power (`Vdd`), and ground (`Gnd`) lines.
   - Optimized for area and performance in integrated circuits.


CMOS Inverter Circuit✅
The schematic of a CMOS inverter is simple:
- Input (A) is connected to the gates of both PMOS and NMOS transistors.
- The source of the PMOS is connected to `Vdd`, and the source of the NMOS is connected to `Gnd`.
- The drains of both transistors are connected together to form the output (Y).

Operation✅
1. Input = 0:
   - PMOS turns ON, NMOS turns OFF.
   - Output is pulled to `Vdd` (logic `1`).

2.Input = 1:
   - PMOS turns OFF, NMOS turns ON.
   - Output is pulled to `Gnd` (logic `0`).
